# For Gallipoli Task-1

- Test cases will be written for Reflected XSS (RXSS), Stored XSS (SXSS) and DOM-Based XSS (DOMXSS) types.
- At least 3 test cases should be prepared for each XSS type: -
For RXSS:
- Injection with POST request + Injection with GET request + Injection from header
- Test cases for SXSS and DOMXSS should be prepared similarly.
